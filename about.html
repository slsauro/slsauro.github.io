           <p>My name is Stacie. I am a 23 year old studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island. My love for web-design started when I was 10 years old. I loved
          creating website blogs and designing the coding and the graphics to my liking. I never stopped doing it, but I never quite expanded my knowledge, so that why I decided to
          attend college for computer science. I hope one day to make a career out of it. I work full-time as a bartender and in my free time I love to spend time with my friends and my 
          sister. <br> <br>I have a strong love for the sport of gymnastics and practiced for 13 years when I was younger.</p></div>
