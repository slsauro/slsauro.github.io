           <p>My name is Stacie. I am a 23 year old studying computer science at the University of Rhode Island. My love for web-design started when I was 10 years old. I loved
          creating website blogs and designing the coding and the graphics to my liking. I never stopped doing it, but I never quite expanded my knowledge, so that why I decided to
          attend college for computer science. I hope one day to make a career out of it. I work full-time as a bartender and in my free time I love to spend time with my friends and my 
          sister. <br> <br>I have a strong love for the sport of gymnastics and practiced for 13 years when I was younger. My hobbies include going to the movies, ice skating, makeup, 
          graphic design and going on nature walks. The two pictures above are of me, my sister, and my niece while on a Thanksgiving vacation to the white mountains in New Hampshire
